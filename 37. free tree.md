When your "cp -r" command failed due to a lack of disk space, it did not clean up after itself. That is, it did not delete the files which it managed to copy before running out of space. It would be a good idea to clean up this mess ourselves.

Recall that the "rmdir" command only deletes empty directories, so we cannot use it to delete the "pools" directory in one fell swoop, since "pools" contains at least one file. The command that allows you to remove an entire directory tree is "rm -r". For example, to remove a directory called "stocks" and all of its subdirectories and files, you would type

                             rm -r stocks
