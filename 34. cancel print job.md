We will show the results of the previous command on this page, so you don't have to flip back and forth.

Uh oh. You just remembered that "zephyr" is a color plotter. Since it would be very wasteful to use such an expensive device to print out jokes for your children, you decide that you had better cancel your print job before anyone notices. The command to remove print jobs is called "lprm", which stands for "line printer remove". For example, to remove print job 148 from print queue "hp14", you would type

                      lprm -P hp14 148
