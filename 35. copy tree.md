Maybe we should give up on Greg Jester for a while and try to get some more interesting files from another friend. It so happens that your friend Belinda Bookie has several sports pools which she keeps online. You decide to copy Belinda's "pools" directory to your home directory, so you can set up your own pools.

The regular "cp" command will not let you copy directories, but if you use the "-r" option, it will. For example, if you wanted to copy a directory called "jokes" from Jester's home directory to your own, you would type

                   cp -r ~jester/jokes ~

This would copy the entire "jokes" directory tree.

Type the command which will copy Belinda's "pools" directory to your home directory.

                   cp -r ~bookie/pools ~
