To see how much disk space you have left on your system, you need to use the "df" command, which stands for "disk free".

                                  df

As you can see, "df" output is not exactly intuitive -- and we've even simplified it a bit. On a real system, the first column is actually "Filesystem", but that column is totally useless to the average user. In our example, the first three columns show the total disk size, the disk space used, and the available disk space. All of these numbers are in kilobytes. Notice that the "Used" and "Available" columns do not add up to the "1k-blocks" (total) column. That is because a percentage of the disk is always set aside for administrative use. In this case, 5% of each disk is reserved.

Actually, if you just ignore the "1k-blocks" column, everything will make more sense, because it is the only one that deals with total disk space, rather than "user" disk space. Since a regular user doesn't have access to the reserved 5% of a disk anyway, you might as well pretend that it doesn't exist.
				
The "Use%" column shows the percentage of user space that is currently used.

The "Mounted on" column shows where the disks reside in your filesystem tree. This column raises enough questions to warrant a separate page of explanation.

The way that hard drives are handled in Linux can be a difficult concept to grasp for Windows users. In Windows, the hard drives are labelled "C:", "D:", etc., and each of them has its own directory tree. As you can see in the diagram at top right, there is absolutely no connection between these trees.

On a Linux system, however, there is only one directory tree. Each hard drive is "mounted" on a particular directory in that tree. For example, the first hard drive is mounted on "/", the root of the tree. Everything contained on that drive has been colored yellow in the diagram at bottom right. The second drive is mounted on "/home". That means that any files or directories under "/home" in the tree will be stored on the second drive rather than on the first one. They are colored blue. Similarly, the third drive has been mounted on "/usr". Its contents have been colored green.

Due to its single-tree approach, the Linux filesystem structure is much more flexible and usable than the Windows structure. This becomes especially evident with networked filesystems, although the details are beyond the scope of this course.

One problem with the "df" command is that you get a list of all of the disks on your system, rather than just the one that you are interested in. Even though it was pretty easy to determine which disk contained your home directory on the previous page, it can actually be quite difficult at times to determine which disk particular files are stored on. Fortunately, there is a way to get the "df" command to figure out which disk contains a particular file or directory and then display statistics only for that disk. For example, if you wanted to get statistics for the disk where your home directory resides, you would type

                                  df ~

Type the command to find out how much disk space is free on the disk where your current directory resides.
			df .
