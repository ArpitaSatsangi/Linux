Now that you know where Jester's joke files are located, you can send them to the printer. However, if you print each of the joke files separately, then they will be printed on separate pages. In the interest of saving paper, you decide to combine these two files into one and then print the new file. Since you do not have permission to create files in Jester's home directory, you will create the combined file in your own home directory.

Before you begin, we need to explain how to combine files. Another word for "combine" is "concatenate". Since that would be a real pain to spell all of the time, the Linux concatenation command is simply "cat". For example, if you wanted to combine files "jabber" and "wocky", you would type

                       cat jabber wocky

This would print the contents of "jabber" and then "wocky" to your screen. "But," you may be saying, "what use is it to have these combined files printed to the screen? I want to create a new file with their contents." You're right. It's almost entirely useless to have "cat" send its output to your screen. But, in order to send its output to a file, you need to learn another new technique, which we'll cover in a couple of pages. For now, let's just ease our way into it.

By the way, you can also combine more than two files simply by adding more filenames to the end of the command. You can even use this command with just one filename argument, in which case, that file's contents alone will be printed to the screen. In fact, many people use "cat", rather than "more", to display the contents of a file. However, we do not recommend using "cat" in this way, since it is not nearly as useful as "more".
