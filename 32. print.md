Okay, we're almost finished. Now we just need to send these jokes to the printer.

Here are the basic Linux print commands:

          lpr           send to printer
          lpq          display print queue
          lprm        remove from print queue

The "lpr" command stands for "line printer", because when the command was developed, it was assumed that you would be using that type of printer. This, of course, is no longer the case for the majority of Linux users. Now, "lpr" can be used to send jobs to PostScript printers, plotters, and any other print devices you can think of.

For example, to send a file named "thoughts" to the default printer, you would type

                            lpr thoughts

To send your file to a printer called "hp14" rather than the default one, you would type

                     lpr -P hp14 thoughts

The '-P' stands for "printer". The printer can have any name that your system administrator chooses, even something like "tower-of-babel", if she feels like it.

Note that "lpr" does not produce any output if the print request was successful.

Well, that's probably more than enough information for this page, so we'll save the explanations of "lpq" and "lprm" until later.
