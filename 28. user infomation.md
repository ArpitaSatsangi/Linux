Now you should know the name of the command used to find out a person's User ID, but you don't know its syntax. Type the appropriate "man" command at the prompt.

man finger

-----------------------------------------

Type the command which will show you Greg's UserID.

finger greg

(login id: jester)

-----------------------------------------

Recall that the original reason we wanted to find out Greg's UserID was so that we could search his home directory.

Type the command to change your location to Greg's home directory.

cd ~jester
