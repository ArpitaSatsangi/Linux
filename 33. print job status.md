At this time, you might want to check on the status of your print job, in case there is a problem with the printer or there are a large numbers of print jobs ahead of your own. 

If you type "lpq" without any arguments, you will be shown the status of all print jobs in the default print queue.

To display all of the print jobs in a different queue, use the '-P' option, just as you would for the "lpr" command. For example, to check on your print job in the "hp14" queue, you would type

                           lpq -P hp14

In the example shown in the terminal, our print job is the only one in the "hp-14" queue. If there were other print jobs ahead of ours, its rank would be something like "4th" rather than "active". The meaning of the rest of the status line should be self-explanatory. Note that the first line in the output shows the status of the print queue itself. If there were a problem with the print queue, it would say something like "Warning: no daemon present".
