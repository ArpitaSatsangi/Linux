Before we start moving the files around, let's take a look in one of them to see what it contains. We'll look at the cobras file to make sure it has the proper information in it.

The "more" command is used to view the contents of a file. For example, to see the contents of the "cobras" file, you would type

                        more cobras

It is called "more" because after it has displayed a page of text, it pauses and puts "-- More --" at the bottom of the screen to let you know that there is more text yet to be shown. To see the next page of text, you just hit the spacebar.
